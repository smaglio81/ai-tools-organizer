## Configuration

You can customize the extension behavior through VS Code settings. Press `Ctrl+,` (or `Cmd+,` on Mac) and search for "Agent Skills":

### Skill Repositories

**Setting**: `agentSkills.skillRepositories`

By default, the extension fetches skills from:
- `anthropics/skills` - Official Anthropic skills
- `pytorch/pytorch` - PyTorch agent skills
- `openai/skills` - OpenAI curated skills
- `formulahendry/agent-skill-code-runner` - Code runner skill

Add custom repositories by modifying this setting:

```json
"agentSkills.skillRepositories": [
  {
    "owner": "your-username",
    "repo": "your-skills-repo",
    "path": "skills",
    "branch": "main"
  }
]
```

### Install Location

**Setting**: `agentSkills.installLocation`

Choose where to install skills in your workspace or home directory:
- `.github/skills` (default)
- `.claude/skills`
- `~/.copilot/skills`
- `~/.claude/skills`

GitHub Copilot CLI can also use skills installed under the user's home directory ([link](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills#about-agent-skills)).

### GitHub Token

**Setting**: `agentSkills.githubToken`

For higher GitHub API rate limits (especially when fetching from many repositories), provide a personal access token:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Create a new token with `public_repo` scope
3. Copy the token
4. Add it to VS Code settings:

```json
"agentSkills.githubToken": "your_token_here"
```

### Cache Timeout

**Setting**: `agentSkills.cacheTimeout`

Set how long (in seconds) to cache skill metadata (default: 3600 seconds / 1 hour)

## Skill Directory Structure

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io). A typical skill structure:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Skill metadata and documentation
├── index.js          # Main skill implementation
├── package.json      # Dependencies (if Node.js based)
└── README.md         # Additional documentation
```

### SKILL.md Format

Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: My Awesome Skill
description: A brief description of what this skill does
license: MIT
compatibility: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus
---

## Usage

## Examples

```

## Commands

The extension provides these commands (accessible via Command Palette `Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- **Agent Skills: Search Skills** - Open search dialog
- **Agent Skills: Clear Search** - Clear search and show all skills
- **Agent Skills: Refresh** - Refresh the marketplace data
- **Agent Skills: Install Skill** - Install selected skill
- **Agent Skills: Uninstall Skill** - Uninstall selected skill
- **Agent Skills: View Skill Details** - Open skill detail panel
- **Agent Skills: Open Skill Folder** - Open installed skill folder in explorer

## Performance

The extension is optimized for performance:

- **Minimal API Calls**: Uses Git Trees API (1 call per repository) + `raw.githubusercontent.com` (no rate limits)
- **Smart Caching**: In-memory cache with configurable timeout
- **Lazy Loading**: Skills are loaded on demand with progress indicators
- **Parallel Fetching**: Multiple repositories are fetched simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### Skills not loading

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify GitHub repositories are accessible
3. If using a private repository, ensure you've provided a valid GitHub token
4. Try clicking the **Refresh** button to reload

### High API usage

1. Install `markdown-it` for better markdown rendering (optional)
2. Consider increasing the cache timeout in settings
3. Provide a GitHub personal access token for higher rate limits

### Skills not appearing in Marketplace

1. Verify the repository path is correct in settings
2. Check that the skills directory exists in the specified branch
3. Ensure SKILL.md files are properly formatted
4. Click **Refresh** to reload the marketplace

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+X` | Open Extensions panel |
| `Ctrl+,` | Open VS Code Settings |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Open Command Palette |

## For Skill Developers

To create skills compatible with this extension:

1. **Follow the SKILL.md specification** with proper YAML frontmatter
2. **Store skills in a public GitHub repository**
3. **Organize skills** in a directory structure with one skill per folder
4. **Document thoroughly** with clear README and usage examples
5. **Include metadata** (license, compatibility, description)

Users can then discover and install your skills through this marketplace!
